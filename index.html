  <p id="intro">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Travelling Salesman Problem</a> is one of the most famous—and infamous—problems in computational mathematics: given a list of cities and the distance between each city and every other city, calculate the shortest route that visits each city and returns to the origin city.</p>
  <p id="intro">There are two types of algorithms available to solve this problem: <em>exact algorithms</em>, which provide an optimal solution given enough running time, and <em>approximating algorithms</em>, which use heuistics to provide answers that are "good enough" for many inputs and with huge reductions in time complexity.</p>
